All fees are payable on a quarterly basis to the service provider and will begin to accrue once The yieldDAO launches. Members have the right to terminate the services of the service provider at any time.

## Does The yieldDAO charge a carry?

Notably, because The yieldDAO is member managed, it does not have any general partner. No member of The yieldDAO or the service provider will be entitled to a carry, unless otherwise agreed to by the members.

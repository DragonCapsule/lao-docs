## How do members of The yieldDAO make investment decisions?

In the spirit of The DAO, The yieldDAO is entirely member directed and managed and any blockchain-based project can apply for funding from The yieldDAO. As a member, you should have some experience in evaluating and investing in startups relying on digital assets.

Each member will have the opportunity to nominate any applicant for funding through the DApp. Once nominated, members or their delegates will have the right to vote on whether to invest in a project through the DApp.

If more members agree vote for an investment than reject an investment during the applicable voting period, The Members will authorize the investment. After a seven day period to enable Members to "rage quit," The yieldDAO DApp will generate the necessary legal agreements and send them to a designated representative for signature. Once digitally signed, The yieldDAO will transfer the investment to the project.

**A yieldDAO member should understand and acknowledge that they must bear the economic risk of this investment.**

## Will The yieldDAO have a general partner?

No, unless the Members make such a decision to appoint a general partner (but that wouldn't be in the spirit of things).

## Will The yieldDAO operate via a thesis?

The yieldDAO is an emergent experiment and thus there is no express investment thesis for The yieldDAO. Members can work together to formulate a thesis and explore investment opportunities. They have the right to develop any investment thesis they agree on.

## What are the terms of investments made by The yieldDAO?

Members will have the right to set the terms of any investment into projects. The yieldDAO works with teams to structure the investment and currently makes investments that range from $25k-$250k (in ether).

## Can foreign entities receive investment from The yieldDAO?

Possibly. Initially, The yieldDAO has only made investments in projects treated as C corporations for tax purposes. It is currently exploring setting up a foreign subsidiary.

## What happens if there are multiple proposals for investment? How do The yieldDAO members make decisions?

Proposals are voted on sequentially to ensure that every application for funding is actually voted on. It also gives The yieldDAO members time to withdraw their undeployed capital (i.e., "rage quit," described further [here](/RageQuitting)) if they do not want to participate in the investment.

## What is the investment period for The yieldDAO?

The yieldDAO has no express investment period. Members can make investments until all contributed capital has been allocated or withdrawn, as discussed further in these FAQs.

## Does The yieldDAO's service provider have any rights to make investment decisions?

The service provider has no role in making investment decisions.

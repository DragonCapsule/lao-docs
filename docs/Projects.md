## How do projects get funded?

Once a funding proposal is submitted for your project, the proposal will be submitted to The yieldDAO members to decide whether to nominate your project for funding.

If your funding proposal is nominated, The yieldDAO members will then vote on whether the project will receive financing from The yieldDAO. If approved by a majority quorum of The yieldDAO Members, the project will then receive financing in the form of a convertible note. All project financing will be allocated to yieldDAO projects in the form of the cryptocurrency ether. Investment amounts have ranged from $50,000-$250,00 (settled primarily in ether).

## How does my project receive funding from the yieldDAO?

Potential yieldDAO projects are asked to apply through an application process that includes the following materials:

- Project name and contact information

- Project description

- Existing investors

- Incorporation information (including Articles of Incorporation)

- Project smart contract address

Once your application is submitted, The yieldDAO members will have the option to nominate a project to receive financing from The yieldDAO. If more than 50% of The yieldDAO members approve a funding proposal, the project will receive financing.

## Do I need to have a blockchain-based product to submit an application?

For the first yieldDAO, our ambition is to create a fund for projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. The yieldDAO members will set forth an investment plan for the type of investments that they wish to finance in The yieldDAO. Feel free to submit a proposal for anything in that realm, whether it be a protocol, dApp, or other project. All are welcome.

## What entity type should be created for my project in order to submit a funding proposal?

We ask that projects who wish to submit a proposal be an entity registered in a U.S. jurisdiction. OpenLaw has some basic incorporation documents (see [here](https://lib.openlaw.io/web/default/template/Template%20Marketplace%20-%20Certificate%20of%20Incorporation)). The yieldDAO members may, however, elect to invest in yieldDAO projects organized outside the US.

**Please seek legal counsel regarding any incorporation documents or questions on entity choice.**

## How much of my project (in terms of equity) will be transferred to the members of the yieldDAO?

The yieldDAO members will have the opportunity to vote on the amount of financing that is provided to approved projects and The yieldDAO's service provider works with the project to settle the investment.

## After a potential yieldDAO project submits an application, can the project change the information that was submitted?

Yes! If a project wishes to change any information that was submitted during the application process, it can do so by contacting us at [hello@yieldDAO.io](mailto:hello@yieldDAO.io).

## How does a project withdraw from The yieldDAO?

During the voting period (prior to being sponsored by a yieldDAO member) potential yieldDAO projects will have the ability to withdraw their funding proposal from The yieldDAO.

Through a smart contract cancelProposal function, potential yieldDAO projects are able to remove their application from consideration for funding from The yieldDAO.

## Who can view information included in project funding proposals?

The yieldDAO project proposals can be set to be private. Project proposals including all materials that are submitted to The yieldDAO are restricted to applicants who submitted a funding proposal and members of The yieldDAO.

Should potential projects have additional questions regarding privacy concerns, please email us at [hello@yieldDAO.io](mailto:hello@yieldDAO.io).
